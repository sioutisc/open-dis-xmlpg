XML Multi-Language Protocol Generator (XMLPG) is described <a
 href="XMLPG.html">here</a><a href="XMLPG.html">.</a><br>
<br>
XMLPG generates Java and C++ language protocol implementations from an
abstract description of the protocol in XML. This release includes an
example partial implementation of the Distributed Interactive
Simulation (DIS) protocol.<br>
<br>
Making use of XMLPG is typically a multi-step process. First of all,
you need to write an XML file that describes the protocol. An example
of this XML file is in the DIS directory, in the file DIS.xml. This
file is used as input to the XMLPG program, which uses it to generate
Java and C++ language implementations of the protocol. These language
files need to be compiled themselves to generate a usable protocol.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Compiling</span><br>
<br>
The XMLPG system uses the Ant make system, available from <a
 href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache.org</a>. The file build.xml
contains several targets for both compiling the basic XMLPG system and
compiling the source code that is generated by XMLPG. From the command
line, and assuming that the ant executable is on the path, you can
cause the targets to execute by typing <span
 style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">ant
&lt;targetName&gt;</span>. A list of some of the targets is below:<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>compile: Compiles the XMLPG program itself</li>
  <li>run: Runs the XMLPG program with an input XML file and the path
to two directories where the Java and C++ source code will be placed.
Generates Java and C++ source code that implements the protocol defined
in the XML file. The input file used in the build.xml file is the
DIS.xml file, which describes the DIS protocol.<br>
  </li>
  <li>dist: default task, does most operations.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
Once the code is generated you should cd to the DIS directory, where a
separate build file is responsible for compiling the generated code.<br>
